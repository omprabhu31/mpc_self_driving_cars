# Trajectory Tracking and Obstacle Avoidance using Python
### Part of  Dual Degree Project - Stage I

This folder contains the relevant code files for simulation of a MPC controller for autonomous vehicle path tracking. The simulation is carried out using Python 3.11.5. The simulation environment used in this model is adapted from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/matssteinweg/Multi-Purpose-MPC).

In order to run the simulation, kindly follow these steps:
* Start an instance of the terminal on your machine, and simply run `python main.py`.
