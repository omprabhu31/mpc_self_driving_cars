# MPC Control for Trajectory Tracking Along a Racetrack
### Part of  Dual Degree Project - Stage I

This folder contains the relevant code files for simulation of a MPC controller for following a reference trajectory along a figure-eight racetrack. The simulation is carried out using Simulink, and you will need the version of Simulink supplied with MATLAB R2023b in order to run the files.

In order to run the simulation, kindly follow these steps:
* Double-click `mpc_figure_eight.slx` to load the model and model parameters in the workspace.
* Run the simulation. You will be able to view a live plot of the reference and actual trajectory of the vehicle as the simulation progresses.
