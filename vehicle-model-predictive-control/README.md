# MPC Control for Trajectory Tracking Along a Racetrack
### Part of  Dual Degree Project - Stage I

Certain function blocks pertaining to the simulation have been adapted from a [GitHub Repository](https://in.mathworks.com/videos/vehicle-path-tracking-using-model-predictive-control-1647494222398.html) owned by Mathworks, namely the sections of the simulation involving 3-DOF vehicle dynamics calculations using the powertrain & driveline systems, and transformations functions for conversion of vehicle states into 3-DOF model parameters.

In order to run the simulation, kindly follow these steps:
* Double-click `mpc_figure_eight.slx` to load the model and model parameters in the workspace.
* Run the simulation. You will be able to view a live plot of the reference and actual trajectory of the vehicle as the simulation progresses.
