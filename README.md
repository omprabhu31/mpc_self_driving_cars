# Obstacle Avoidance and Control of Autonomous Vehicles using Model Predictive Control
## Dual Degree Project - Stage I

This repository contains all the work completed so far as part of my dual degree project. Some of it is derivative of existing optimal control models - kindly consult the Stage 1 project report for the relevant sources (`/_stage_1_report/Main.pdf`). You can find instructions to run individual models in their respective folders.

Please feel free to contact me regarding any queries and/or suggestions regarding the project.
